# [D&D5] Loot Generator

[D&D5] Loot Generator as the title says, is a loot table generator for D&D 5 games, it generates money drops for monsters from lvl 0 (1 actually) up to lvl 20, there is two different types of loots, one for small group of trash mobs, and one for bigger encounters with no loot tables described in the adventure. 

As for now all of these are implemented but only for currency.

Later on I'll try to implement a roll on Gems/Art objects and display which type of gems/items dropped.

I'll also implement a roll on magical objects.

All these elements are taken from this website : https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/treasure.html

I just transform them into an Ionic small project, for my games and to practice Ionic.
